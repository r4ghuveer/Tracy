## Description :

Tracy is a voice automation software that takes user voice as instruction and performs the required task.

: Created a voice command automation software that takes the user’s voice input and performs
the required task. In Python, I used the voice recognition library for converting the user’s voice into text 
input and the pyttsx3 library to make a text-to-speech response. I used various Python libraries to create
the automation functionalities. For building the user interface I used Electron JS.
